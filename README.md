#Day 01:
Project #01: Simple Calculator with Dark and Light modes.
I've created a simple calculator with basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and added a cool twist â€“ you can toggle between dark and light modes! ðŸŒ“

Key Features:
âœ¨ Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
ðŸŒ“ Dark and light mode toggle
ðŸ’» Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Why I Built This:
ðŸ‘‰ To practice and solidify my JavaScript skills
ðŸ‘‰ Explore DOM manipulation for a dynamic user interface
ðŸ‘‰ Add a touch of creativity with the dark/light mode feature

This is the first Project i built in my 50 days 50 projects challenge
